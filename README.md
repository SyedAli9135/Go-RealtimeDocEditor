# Go-RealtimeDocEditor

**Go-RealtimeDocEditor** is a real-time collaborative document editing tool built using Go for the backend. It allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, with live updates, version control, and a robust synchronization mechanism. This project leverages WebSockets for real-time communication and uses a client-server architecture to facilitate collaborative editing.

## Features

### 1. **Real-Time Collaboration**
   - Users can collaboratively edit documents in real-time, with each change instantly reflected across all active users.
   - Real-time updates are handled using **WebSockets** to ensure low-latency communication between clients and the server.

### 2. **Version Control & History**
   - Every document update is versioned, allowing users to roll back to previous versions if necessary.
   - A robust **document revision history** ensures that users can access previous versions of a document.

### 3. **Authentication and User Management**
   - Secure user authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.
   - Users can be assigned roles (e.g., editor, viewer) to control access permissions and ensure that documents are shared securely.
   
### 4. **Document Synchronization**
   - The application utilizes **Operational Transformation (OT)** to handle concurrent document edits and ensure that changes from multiple users do not conflict.
   - Real-time synchronization allows multiple users to see edits in the document as they happen, including text changes, cursor movements, and formatting updates.

### 5. **Cloud Storage**
   - Documents are stored securely in the cloud, allowing for scalable access and storage management.
   - The system supports both text and media (like images) for more comprehensive document editing.

### 6. **Commenting & Collaboration Features**
   - Users can add comments and annotations to specific sections of the document, facilitating better communication during the editing process.
   - User interactions, like cursor positioning and typing, are visualized in real-time for all users.

### 7. **Security**
   - End-to-end encryption ensures that document data remains secure both in transit (via HTTPS/WebSockets) and at rest (in the database).
   - Permissions and access control mechanisms ensure that only authorized users can view or edit documents.

## High-Level Architecture

The **Go-RealtimeDocEditor** is structured around several key components that work together to provide seamless real-time document editing. The architecture is as follows:

```
            +---------------------------+
            |      Web/Mobile Client     |
            |  (Text Editor Interface)   |
            +---------------------------+
                       |
                       | (WebSocket, REST API, WebRTC)
                       v
            +---------------------------+
            |    Real-time Sync Server   |  <--------------------------+
            | (Handles live updates,     |                           |

### Explanation of the Components:

1. **Web/Mobile Client**: 
   - The user-facing application where users can edit documents. It features real-time updates and collaborative editing with a rich text editor.
   
2. **Real-Time Sync Server**: 
   - Handles synchronization of document changes in real-time. It uses WebSockets to provide immediate feedback to users and ensures consistency across clients.

3. **Collaboration Management Server**: 
   - Manages user actions within a document, tracks cursor movements, and resolves conflicts between simultaneous edits using algorithms like **Operational Transformation (OT)**.

4. **Authentication Server**: 
   - Handles user authentication and authorization via JWT tokens. It ensures only authenticated users have access to specific documents.

5. **Document Database**: 
   - Stores document content and metadata. It keeps a full version history of each document for rollback and audit purposes.

6. **User Profile Database**: 
   - Stores user information such as roles, access permissions, and settings for each document.

7. **File Storage Service**: 
   - A cloud-based file storage system where documents are securely saved and retrieved. This may involve a solution like **AWS S3** or another scalable storage service.

8. **Backup & Versioning**: 
   - Ensures data integrity by maintaining regular backups and version history. Users can retrieve past versions of a document if necessary.
